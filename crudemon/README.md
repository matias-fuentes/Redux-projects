## Description

Step into the captivating world of Pokémon with Crudemon, the ultimate webpage for trainers of all levels. Seamlessly manage your Pokémon collection, from creating new creatures to reading their unique stats, updating their abilities, and even bidding them farewell if needed. With Crudemon, you have the power to nurture and evolve your favorite Pokémons, creating a team that reflects your strategic prowess.

## Sidenotes

- Now with the new version of Crudemon with the new JavaScript superset that I've learned; TypeScript, the types and confidentiality when pushing is stronger than ever.
- Also, I fixed the READ unit test error which stopped the execution for an error that I was accidentally throwing.

## Features

- NEW! Redux implementation!
- Responsive design.
- CRUD completed and functional.
- Refactored code and smart and an exhaustive use of the reuse capability through the React components.
- Capacity to manage your own Pokémons.
- Proper page integration with the REST API and its respective endpoints.
- TDD End to End testing.
- Full of good practices and its key factor: passion.

P.D.: I made a video presenting the project! I strongly recommend to you to watch it (keep in mind that it's in Spanish). Above of this same README, in the links section, you'll find a direct link if you want to watch it :).
